# Location Based Quiz

This repository contains the code for the server that is required to run the Location Based Quiz system that was created for the module 'Web and Mobile GIS - Apps and Programming' at UCL.

This system comprises of two applications:  **a mobile application** and **a web application**. Together, these applications aim to create a functional location-based quiz. The overall purpose of this application is to encourage users to explore new places, whilst also learning something about the locations they visit through the answering of multi choice trivia questions.

## The Mobile Application
[The mobile application](https://github.com/nikscrits/quiz) is the user interface for the system where the user can track their location and answer nearby questions. It can be downloaded to an android phone using [this link](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3152351/builds).

## The Web Application
[The web application](https://github.com/nikscrits/questions) is the administrator interface where questions can be set for the users to answer. It can be accessed from [this link](https://http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31288/) when both the httpServer.js (found in this repository) and the phonegap server (found in the web application repository) are running.
