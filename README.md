# Location Based Quiz Server

This repository contains the code for the server required to run both the webpage and mobile application associated with the Locased Based Quiz. 

* The mobile application ([repository](https://github.com/nikscrits/quiz)) is the user interface for the system where the user can track their location and answer nearby questions. It can be downloaded to an android phone from [this link](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3152351/builds).

* The web application ([repository](https://github.com/nikscrits/questions)) is the administrator interface where questions can be set for the users to answer. It can be accessed from [this link](https://http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31288/) when both the httpServer.js (found in this repository) and the phonegap server (found in the web application repository) are running.
